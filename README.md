# Flipkart_mobile_data_analysis

For this Analysis, I fetched Flipkart Mobile data on 4th of june 2023 from it's web by using Power BI Desktop.
Then Data Preprocessing like Data Manupulation like Renameing columns, Making new columns, Removing Unnecessary columns etc was done in Power BI query.
And then did my data analysis on the data by using 'Ask me question' AI generated feature in Power BI Desktop.
